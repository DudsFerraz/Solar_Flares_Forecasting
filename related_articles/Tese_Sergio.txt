ENHANCING SOLAR FLARE FORECASTING: A MULTI-CLASS AND MULTI-LABEL CLASSIFICATION APPROACH TO HANDLE IMBALANCED TIME SERIES





solar flare forecasting has significant challenges:
	(a) the sequence of data influences the phenomena and should be tracked;
	(b) the features and intervals that cause and influence the phenomena are not defined;
	(c) the forecasting should be performed in an affordable time;
	(d) the data is highly imbalanced;
	(e) adjacent classes are sometimes difficult to distinguish;
	(f) the majority approaches perform binary forecasting (aggregating solar flare classes), instead of multi-class, as actually required.
This work proposed a method that tackles these challenges simultaneously.

First, we aimed to forecast the X-ray levels expected for the next few days. We proposed the SeMiner method... That allows to consider the sequence of instances in the mining process, handling challenge (a).

feature selection is employed in order to determine which interval of data in the time series, most influences the forecasting process, handling challenge (b).

Then, the processed sequences are submitted to a traditional classifier to generate a model that predicts future X-ray levels.

Second, we parallelized SS to increase its performance, (by implementing it in CUDA platform) in order to tackle issue (c).

Third, we improved SeMiner to tackle the remaining challenges by developing a new method called Ensemble of classifiers for imbalanced datasets (ECID). Which tackled issue (c).

Using a modified bootstrap approach, an aggregation method combines the inducers results, enabling a multi-class and multi-label forecasting and thus, handling the issue of adjacent classes (e).
