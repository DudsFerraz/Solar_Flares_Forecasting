# Time Series Forecasting Using Artificial Neural Networks Methodologies - A Systematic Review

### _**[Link de acesso](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2314728817300715)**_

## `Abstract`
#### This paper studies the advances in time series forecasting models using artificial neural network methodologies in a systematic literature review. The systematic review has been done using a manual search of the published papers in the last 11 years (2006–2016) for the time series forecasting using new neural network models and the used methods are displayed. In the covered period in the study, the results obtained found 17 studies that meet all the requirements of the search criteria. Only three of the obtained proposals considered a process different to the autoregressive of a neural networks model. These results conclude that, although there are many studies that presented the application of neural network models, but few of them proposed new neural networks models for forecasting that considered theoretical support and a systematic procedure in the construction of model. This leads to the importance of formulating new models of neural networks.

## `Conclusões Pessoais`
* Em geral, os modelos desenvolvidos no período não satisfizeram os critérios previamente estabelecidos para o desenvolvimento de um novo modelo baseado em redes neurais.
* Evidências apontam para modelos híbridos sendo mais precisos do que os tradicionais.
* Não foram registrados avanços substanciais.

# Hybrid Forecasting Methods - A Systematic Review

### _**[Link de acesso](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/12/9/2019)**_

## `Abstract`
#### Time series forecasting has been performed for decades in both science and industry. The forecasting models have evolved steadily over time. Statistical methods have been used for many years and were later complemented by neural network approaches. Currently, hybrid approaches are increasingly presented, aiming to combine both methods’ advantages. These hybrid forecasting methods could lead to more accurate predictions and enhance and improve visual analytics systems for making decisions or for supporting the decision-making process. In this work, we conducted a systematic literature review using the PRISMA methodology and investigated various hybrid forecasting approaches in detail. The exact procedure for searching and filtering and the databases in which we performed the search were documented and supplemented by a PRISMA flow chart. From a total of 1435 results, we included 21 works in this review through various filtering steps and exclusion criteria. We examined these works in detail and collected the quality of the prediction results. We summarized the error values in a table to investigate whether hybrid forecasting approaches deliver better results. We concluded that all investigated hybrid forecasting methods perform better than individual ones. Based on the results of the PRISMA study, the possible applications of hybrid prediction approaches in visual analytics systems for decision making are discussed and illustrated using an exemplary visualization.

## `Conclusões Pessoais`
* Diferentes abordagens, para diferentes base de dados de diversos domínios diferentes foram testadas.
* Em geral, os modelos híbridos se mostraram claramente superiores do que modelos 'individuais'.
* É impossível afirmar qual das abordagens é a melhor, já que os resultados são altamente dependentes dos dados em questão. A escolha de um modelo em vez de outro deve ser feita caso a caso.

# A Systematic Review for Transformer-Based Long-Term Series Forecasting

### _**[Link de acesso](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20218)**_

## `Abstract`
#### The emergence of deep learning has yielded noteworthy advancements in time series forecasting (TSF). Transformer architectures, in particular, have witnessed broad utilization and adoption in TSF tasks. Transformers have proven to be the most successful solution to extract the semantic correlations among the elements within a long sequence. Various variants have enabled transformer architecture to effectively handle long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) tasks. In this article, we first present a comprehensive overview of transformer architectures and their subsequent enhancements developed to address various LTSF tasks. Then, we summarize the publicly available LTSF datasets and relevant evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we provide valuable insights into the best practices and techniques for effectively training transformers in the context of time-series analysis. Lastly, we propose potential research directions in this rapidly evolving field.

## `Conclusões Pessoais`
* A arquitetura Transformer é muito eficaz para tarefas de séries temporais, especialmente LTSFs (Long-Term Time Series Forecasting). Tendo desempenho comparável ou superior aos tradicionais RNNs e LSTMs, com a vantagem de ser computacionalmente mais eficiente.
* Várias adaptações são necessárias a partir da arquitetura original para lidar eficientemente com séries temporais, o que traz desafios para o processo de treinamento.
* Modelos Transformer não são uma solução universal para todas as tarefas de LTSF, mas podem ser muito úteis.
